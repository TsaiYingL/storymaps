            John Hanke, the founder of Niantic, has a long history of working on geospatial data 
            visualization applications. He worked on applications such as Google Maps and Google Earth 
            before he formed Niantic in 2010 as an internal startup in Google. In 2015, Niantic spun 
            out as an independent company after Google's announcement of its restructuring as Alphabet 
            Inc.
        </p>

        <p>
            The company continues to focus on geospatial data visualization as it progress. Some work 
            they have done in the past are developed Pokémon GO, Pikmin Bloom, Lightship Platform, 
            etc. The success of Pokémon GO alone is a testament to Niantic’s reach—it has amassed over 
            650 million downloads, with players collectively covering 15.8 billion kilometers.This 
            staggering scale highlights the enormous volume of user-generated geospatial data Niantic 
            has accumulated, making it one of the most data-rich companies in AR and location-based 
            gaming.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beyond gaming, Niantic also conducted research on 3D mapping, Virtual Occlusions Through 
            Implicit Depth, and Accurate Plane Estimation via 3D-Consistent Embeddings. Its role in 
            both gaming and AR and spatial computing research demonstrates its position in 
            surveillance-based technological advancement.

      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

      <p>
        Niantic’s privacy policy was last updated on July 15, 2024, and it outlines the types of 
        data it collects, who have access to the data, and how the data is utilized. In my case, 
        the company gathers information such as my email address, Nintendo account, device 
        location, in-app achievements, and more. Once collected, these data are shared with 
        service providers, other users, and third parties.
      </p>

      <p>
        When reading through the privacy policy, one line that caught my attention is Niantic’s 
        ability to track “the web page [users] were visiting before accessing our Services.” This 
        suggests that Niantic is not only surveilling my actions in Pikmin Bloom, but also 
        monitoring what I am doing before I open their app. This information is valuable to 
        Niantic because it gives the company more insight into my interests and habits, which 
        allows Niantic to provide more personalized advertisements. This increases my possibility 
        of in app purchases, resulting in more revenues for the company. Thus, it is not difficult 
        to see how Niantic profits from selling user data to external entities for targeted 
        advertising.
      </p>

      <p>
        Niantic’s privacy policy also explicitly states that “information that we collect from our users, including Personal Data, is a business asset.” This aligns with Shoshana Zuboff’s concept of surveillance capitalism, where personal data is not only collected for service improvement, but treated as a corporate asset. As Zuboff explains, “revenues depend upon data assets appropriated through ubiquitous automated operations. These constitute a new asset class: surveillance assets” (303)​. In other words, companies like Niantic do not simply collect data to enhance user experience; they actively convert personal information into financial gain by making it a commercial commodity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Furthermore, this practice reflects what Zuboff describes as "the material instantiation of [F. A.] Hayek’s ‘extended order’” (p. 303)​, where surveillance technology operates as an all-encompassing system of data extraction and behavioral prediction. The act of tracking what users do before accessing an app illustrates how surveillance extends beyond voluntary interactions—it begins even before the user engages with the service, which reinforces the pervasive and automated nature of surveillance capitalism.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another possible usage of my data is on their research. As I mentioned before, Niantic conducts independent research to enhance their geospatial data visualization applications. Through their existing apps, the company is able to mass generate data that contributes to their research. One example of this is the AR mode in Pikmin Bloom. The function asks permission to access my camera so I can interact with Pikmins in “real life.” While this feature enhances user engagement, it also provides Niantic with valuable visual data. These data then can be used in their research on Virtual Occlusions Through Implicit Depth, and improving their services, making Nianti’s products more attractive to new users. This, in turn, creates a self-perpetuating cycle: improved technology attracts more users, generating even more data for further research, which then enhances future products and strengthens Niantic’s market position.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, most users are unaware that they are participating in this cycle. This aligns with Cohen’s idea of “prosumer” mentioned in “The Valorization of Surveillance,” where “all member activity can be conceived of as immaterial labour that benefits the company” without realizing (299). This concept directly applies to my experience with Pikmin Bloom, where I provide Niantic my location data, movement patterns, and in-app behaviors. What makes this particularly concerning is the lack of transparency. Pikmin Bloom presents itself as a fun way to log daily activities and track health, but in reality, it is quietly extracting user data for purposes beyond what most players recognize. However, players are not explicitly informed about how their interactions contribute to Naintic’s research. Without greater transparency, apps like Pikmin Bloom reinforce the hidden structures of surveillance capitalism, where personal experiences become raw material for corporate profit.
