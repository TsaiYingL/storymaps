                        John Hanke, the founder of Niantic, has a long history of developing geospatial data visualization applications. He worked on applications such as Google Maps and Google Earth before forming Niantic in 2010 as an internal Google startup. In 2015, Niantic became independent after Google announced its restructuring as Alphabet Inc.

                        The company continues to focus on geospatial data visualization as it progresses. Some of their past work includes developing Pokémon GO, Pikmin Bloom, Lightship Platform, etc. Pokémon GO's success alone is a testament to Niantic’s reach—it has amassed over 650 million downloads, with players collectively covering 15.8 billion kilometers. This staggering scale highlights the enormous volume of user-generated geospatial data Niantic has accumulated, making it one of the most data-rich companies in AR and location-based gaming.

                        Beyond gaming, Niantic also conducted research on 3D mapping, Virtual Occlusions Through Implicit Depth, and Accurate Plane Estimation via 3D-consistent Embedding. Its role in gaming, AR, and spatial computing research demonstrates its position in surveillance-based technological advancement.

            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <div>

                <p>
                    Niantic’s privacy policy was last updated on July 15, 2024, and it outlines the types of data it collects, who has access to the data, and how it is utilized. In my case, the company gathers information such as my email address, Nintendo account, device location, in-app achievements, and more. Once collected, these data are shared with service providers, other users, and third parties.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    When reading through the privacy policy, one line that caught my attention is Niantic’s ability to track “the web page [users] were visiting before accessing our Services.” This suggests that Niantic is surveilling my actions in Pikmin Bloom and monitoring what I am doing before I open their app. This information is valuable to Niantic because it gives the company more insight into my interests and habits, allowing it to provide more personalized advertisements. This increases my possibility of in-app purchases, resulting in more revenues for the company. Thus, it is not difficult to see how Niantic profits from selling user data to external entities for targeted advertising.

                <p>
                    Niantic’s privacy policy also explicitly states, “information that we collect from our users, including Personal Data, is a business asset.” This aligns with Shoshana Zuboff’s concept of surveillance capitalism, where personal data is not only collected for service improvement but treated as a corporate asset. As Zuboff explains, “revenues depend upon data assets appropriated through ubiquitous automated operations. These constitute a new asset class: surveillance assets.” (303)​. In other words, companies like Niantic do not simply collect data to enhance user experience; they actively convert personal information into financial gain by making it a commercial commodity.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    Furthermore, this practice reflects what Zuboff describes as "the material instantiation of [F. A.] Hayek’s ‘extended order’” (303)​, where surveillance technology operates as an all-encompassing system of data extraction and behavioral prediction. The act of tracking what users do before accessing an app illustrates how surveillance extends beyond voluntary interactions—it begins even before the user engages with the service, which reinforces the pervasive and automated nature of surveillance capitalism.

                <p>
                    Another possible usage of my data is in their research. As mentioned, Niantic conducts independent research to enhance its geospatial data visualization applications. Through their existing apps, the company can mass generate data that contributes to their research. One example of this is the AR mode in Pikmin Bloom. The function asks permission to access my camera so I can interact with Pikmins in “real life.” While this feature enhances user engagement, it also provides Niantic with valuable visual data. These data can then be used in their research on virtual inclusions through implicit depth, improving their services and making Nianti’s products more attractive to new users. This, in turn, creates a self-perpetuating cycle: improved technology attracts more users, generating even more data for further research, which then enhances future products and strengthens Niantic’s market position.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    However, most users are unaware that they are participating in this cycle. This aligns with Cohen’s idea of “prosumer” mentioned in “The Valorization of Surveillance,” where “all member activity can be conceived of as immaterial labor that benefits the company” without realizing (299). This concept directly applies to my experience with Pikmin Bloom, where I provide Niantic with my location data, movement patterns, and in-app behaviors. What makes this particularly concerning is the lack of transparency. Pikmin Bloom presents itself as a fun way to log daily activities and track health, but in reality, it is quietly extracting user data for purposes beyond what most players recognize. However, players are not explicitly informed about how their interactions contribute to Naintic’s research. Without greater transparency, apps like Pikmin Bloom reinforce the hidden structures of surveillance capitalism, where personal experiences become raw material for corporate profit.
