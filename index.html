            Being healthy has always been a priority for many people. From carefully counting calories for each meal to tracking the number of steps taken each day, everything is carefully measured to ensure the health goals are met. After coming to Stony, I inevitably became one of those individuals when I noticed my weight gradually increasing. To address this issue, I decided to take more steps, and to monitor my progress, I downloaded Pikmin Bloom. However, in order for the app to track my steps accurately, I have to give Niantic, the company that created Pikmin Bloom, access to my location. Through this project, I will explore how my interaction with Pikmin Bloom involves surveillance and how Niantic might use the data collected from my daily activities.
