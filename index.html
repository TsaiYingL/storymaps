        Being healthy has always been a priority for many people. From carefully counting calories 
        for each meal to tracking the number of steps taken each day, everything is carefully 
        measured to ensure the health goals are met. I inevitably became one of those individuals 
        when I noticed my weight gradually increasing after coming to Stony Brook University. 
        To address this issue, I decided to take more steps and, to monitor my progress, I 
        downloaded Pikmin Bloom. However, in order for the app to track my steps accurately, I 
        have to give Niantic, the company that created Pikmin Bloom, access to my location. 
        Through this project, I will explore how my interaction with Pikmin Bloom involves 
        surveillance and how Niantic might use the data collected from my daily activities.
