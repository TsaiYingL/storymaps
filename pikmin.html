                        Pikmin Bloom is a reality mobile game developed by Niantic in 2020. The game provides players with pots that contain the Pickmin seed inside and asks users to grow the Pikmin by walking outside. The users can also find resources like more pots or sectors used to upgrade the Pikmin. After having a certain number of Pikmin, the user can send them on missions to fight the mushrooms and collect more sectors.

                        In the meantime, it keeps track of the places you’ve been and asks for a daily log at the end of each day. It asks for your mood and photos you took for the day, and the user is also able to leave a little message for each log. For the purpose of this project, I will mainly focus on my logs in February.

                    The quantification of steps and the rewarding system in Pikmin Bloom encourages me to spend more time outside, turning physical activity into a gamified experience. The daily logs in Pikmin Bloom also serve as a personal record, reminding me of small, positive moments throughout my day. The benefits that I received in exchange from being surveilled not only enhances my motivation to stay active but also contributes to my mental well-being.

                    The concept of willingly participating in surveillance connects to Anders Albrechtslund’s idea where users “voluntarily engage with other people and construct identities” through online social networking (320). While I didn’t add any friends on Pikmin Bloom, I still experienced a form of self-surveillance that allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of my habits and interests. By reflecting on the places I have been to and my thoughts, it helps me monitor my fitness progress and build a sense of accomplishment.

                <p>
                    While Pikmin Bloom provided me many benefits as I engaged with the app, it is important not to overlook the potential dangers brought by this type of surveillance. To do this, I will examine Niantic, the company that created Pikmin Bloom, to analyze what data they collect from their users and how they utilize this information.
